Dear TA,

Note for TA when grading the program:
1. Sometimes if you can't see anything on the painting window, try resizing the window a bit to get the result. This can happen when you are doing automatic painting or doing manual painting.
When you encounter something weird, just try tor resize the window first for quick solution.

2. Lab 4210 is using VS Studio 2015. Tried running the program on 2015 and the program will work if we don't upgrade the compilers (just use 2013 compiler version) 

Thanks for reading. We hope this helps you.

Best,
Andrea and Terrance
